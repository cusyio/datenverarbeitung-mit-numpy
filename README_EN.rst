Data Processing with NumPy
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------

Basic knowledge of Python

Outcome
-------

After this course you will be able to write your own programs for
processing data with NumPy and optimize them.

Target Audience
---------------

Analysts, researchers and engineers who would like to carry out
numerical calculations on their data.

Course Description
------------------

NumPy is the most frequently used Python library for processing
numerical data. It combines a programmer-friendly Python interface with
the speed of an implementation in pure C. NumPy allows to implement
calculations with large data series and matrices with few lines of code.
Therefore, NumPy is a perfect fit to optimize the runtime of Python
programs.

In this course you will get a hands-on introduction of NumPys
essentials, featuring many practical examples. To build upon the basic
functionality, the SciPy package featuring a plethora of mathematical
tools that make the best use of NumPy will be covered as well.

Duration
--------
